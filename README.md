# Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction Using Python with Data Science

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction** project uses machine learning and data science techniques to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. This dataset originates from the **Pima Indian population**, collected by the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**.

The goal is to analyze patterns and build predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals for early intervention.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand and clean the Pima Indians dataset.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find correlations between features and diabetes.
* Train and evaluate machine learning models for prediction.
* Visualize data insights and model performance.
* Apply Python-based data science techniques for health analytics.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used

* **Python 3.8+**
* **NumPy** – Numerical computation
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms and evaluation
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development environment

## 🧩 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**

   * Import dataset using `pandas`.
   * Load CSV file and inspect structure.

2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handle missing or zero values in features such as BMI, Glucose, and BloodPressure.
   * Check for duplicates and outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualize distributions and correlations.
   * Generate heatmaps and pair plots.
   * Identify important features influencing diabetes.

4. **Data Splitting**

   * Split dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80:20 ratio).

5. **Model Building**

   * Train multiple machine learning models:

     * Logistic Regression
     * Random Forest Classifier
     * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     * Decision Tree

6. **Model Evaluation**

   * Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
   * Select the best-performing model.

7. **Prediction**

   * Predict diabetes status for new patient data.

## ✅ Advantages

* Helps in early detection and preventive care of diabetes.
* Demonstrates practical use of data science for healthcare applications.
* Easy to extend with additional health parameters.
* Can integrate with IoT health-monitoring systems.

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Based on a specific population (Pima Indian women) — may not generalize to others.
* Medical prediction models must be used with expert supervision.
* Data imbalance may affect model accuracy.
